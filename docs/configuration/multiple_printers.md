Fluidd allows you to connect to multiple printers from a single host.
Your moonraker configuration for each printer you wish to connect to
may require specific setup in order for this configuration to work.

This type of setup is also highly dependent on your network environment.

Reading through the documentation surrounding `cors_domains` in the
[moonraker config docs](/configuration/moonraker#cors-domains) should
help explain some requirements.

### Example

Assuming you have a single host setup with Fluidd, by way of a
[docker installation](/installation/docker) or
[fluiddpi installation](/installation/fluiddpi);

1. Note the URL you use to access Fluidd
   - For this example, let's assume you access Fluidd on `http://fluidd.local`

2. On your fluidd host, when adding a new printer url - add the full address
   to your printer E.g., `http://myprinter.local`.

3. If step #2 fails
   - Make sure moonraker is running, and accessable. You can try to directly test
     moonraker by going here; `http://myprinter.local/server/info`. If this URL
     works, and you still can't connect - please review the
     [moonraker config docs](/configuration/moonraker#cors-domains)

The `cors_domains` section does allow for wildcards to make this easier, and
FluiddPI ships with sane defaults. You can see an example
[here](/configuration/moonraker_conf) of a configuration that works for
`http://app.fluidd.xyz` along with many common network setups.

### Troubleshooting

If you're entering a printer URL into the add printer dialog, but Fluidd won't let me save...

Fluidd won't let you save a new printer if it can't confirm moonraker is running. To
confirm a moonraker printer instance, try browsing directly to the moonraker API;

```yaml
http://myprinter.local/server/info
# or;
http://myprinter.local:7125/server/info
```

Be sure to replace `myprinter.local` with the host you're trying to connect to.

If neither of the above url examples work, then moonraker is incorrectly configured
on your printer.

If they do return a valid response, but fluidd still won't allow you to save,
then refer to the above configuration example to ensure moonraker is configured
to accept connections from your fluidd host.
