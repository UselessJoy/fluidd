Fluidd allows you to adjust your dashboard layout to your liking. Use the
hamburger menu and click the `adjust layout` option.

Use the drag handles to move cards to / from the left and right columns. You
can also easily disable cards if you have no use for them.

Once you're done, click the exit layout mode button. You can reset back to
the default layout by clicking reset layout.
